ideally, next release will see:
-------------------------------


on the horizon:
---------------
creating new notes with preset content (from command line, from files, from middle click)
continue even if ~/.config/xpad is unavailable
transparency
documentation rewrite


when I get to it:
-----------------
arbitrary drawing (would probably want xinput support)
undo


ideas that I don't currently plan to implement:
-----------------------------------------------
applets for various WMs (hopefully we can standardize on eggtray)


Let us know at xpad-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
what you would like to see!
