--------------------------------------------------------------------------
KNOWN BUGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	If edit lock is enabled, a pad will sometimes get in a state in
		which it will not leave edit mode.  Other pads are not 
		affected, nor is there any conflict with other windows.  But,
		the only way to lock the pad again is to close it and restart.
		If you have any information about this problem (like how to
		reliably reproduce it), please don't hesitate to send a
		bug report to xpad-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.
	
	If WM stickiness is changed through mixed calls to the WM and 
		pad controls, xpad may think the stickiness is incorrect.
		This has no effect on xpad's behavior.  Just toggle the 
		sticky control on the pad to correct it.
	Stickiness may or may not work with your window manager.  It is
		broken on at least Oroborus.
	
	When moving a pad, if the toolbar times out and disappears,
		the pad is not resized to remove the space the toolbar took up.
		This happens on at least Gnome.
		This does *not* happen on at least Blackbox and
			Oroborus.
	
	If you have any patches / suggestions, please email us at
		xpad-devel@lists.sourceforge.net and let us know so we can 
		do something about it.  It will never get fixed if we don't
		know about it!
